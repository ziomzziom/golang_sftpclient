<p>The code in sftpclient.go implements an SFTP client in Go language. It connects to an SFTP server using SSH, authenticates with a username and password, and then opens an SFTP session to upload a file to the server.</p>

<p>The script prompts the user to enter their SFTP username, password, server IP address, and filename to upload. It then establishes a connection to the server, opens an SFTP session, and creates a remote file on the server with the same filename as the local file.</p>

<p>The script implements rate limiting and IP blocking to prevent excessive upload attempts from the same IP address. If an IP address attempts to upload more than three times within a certain time period, the script blocks that IP address for a minute before allowing any further attempts.</p>

<p>Overall, the code provides a basic SFTP client implementation with some additional security features to prevent abuse and protect the server.</p>
